## Student Performance Indicator using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict student performance based on various features such as study hours, previous grades, and other relevant academic metrics using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and model evaluation. 

This project involves the following stages:  
 Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathered and cleaned student performance data.  
 Model Training: Used machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees) to build a predictive model.  
 Model Evaluation: Evaluated the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy and RMSE.  

The goal of the project is to predict a student's final grade based on input features such as study hours, age, and previous grades.  

Technologies Used  
 Python - Main programming language  
 Scikit-learn - Machine learning library for model training  
 Pandas, NumPy - Data manipulation and analysis  
 Matplotlib/Seaborn - Data visualization for model insights
