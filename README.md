## Student Performance Indicator using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict student performance based on various features such as their reading scores, writing scores, parental level of education etc using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, model evaluation and deployment. 

The project predicts the math score of a student based on various features mentioned above. The model is trained using the following dataset - [Student Performance in Exams](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams) and it understands how a student's performance is affected by other features like geder, ethinicity, parental level of education, test preparation course etc. The dataset mentioned consists of 8 columns and 1000 rows. 

This project involves the following stages:  
 Data Collection, Preprocessing & Exploratory Data Analysis: Gathered and cleaned student performance data.  
 Model Training: Used machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees) to build a predictive model.  
 Model Evaluation: Evaluated the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy and RMSE.  
 Model Deployment: The model is deployed using Flask and microsoft Azure. 

The goal of the project is to predict a student's final grade based on input features such as study hours, age, and previous grades.
